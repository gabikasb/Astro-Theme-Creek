I have remembered [a syntax episode on dev tools](https://syntax.fm/show/366/dev-tools-power-elements-tab)  where the guys were so happy about firefox 3d dom view. 

My joy was short, [FF have long deprecated the feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/3D_View) -  would be great to know the reasons, comment if you found anything on that!
